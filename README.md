## Java OOP Exercises

This is my personal repository of the OOP exercises on OASIS-UET I have done.

#### Notes

- These source codes are for referencing/educational purposes only.
If you are also doing exercises on OASIS, I will not be responsible for you being detected for code plagiarism.  
(Yes, OASIS does have a code copy/plagiarism detection, though information on how sophisticated it is scarce)
- These are just my answers to the exercises, and *only* as answers to exercises, no extra features included.
They will pass all test cases should those not change over years/semesters as another method to prevent code copying.
- There *will* be some coding style inconsistencies
(incomplete or uninformative comments/javadocs, unusual/complex implementations and solutions to problems, and so on)
which can't be helped because I don't have time to go back and refactor them.
- There are also custom JUnit Tests I made just because I wanted to practice making Unit Tests.
You can also reference or even use those to your liking.
