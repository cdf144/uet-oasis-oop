This is my personal repository of the OOP exercises on OASIS-UET I have done.

#### Notes

- These source codes are for referencing/educational purposes only. If you are also doing exercises on OASIS, I will not be responsible for you being detected for code plagiarism.  
(Yes, OASIS does have a code copy/plagiarism detection, though I am not sure how sophisticated and deep the analysis is, nor do I have knowledge of what the threshold of being categorized as plagiarism is)
- These are just my answers to the exercises, and *only* as answers to exercises, no extra functions included. They will pass all test cases should those not change over years/semesters as another method to prevent code copying.
- There *will* be some coding style inconsistencies (incomplete or uninformative comments/javadocs, unusual/complex implementations and solutions to problems, and so on)
which can't be helped because I don't have time to go back and refactor them.
- There are also custom JUnit Tests I made just because I wanted to practice making Unit Tests.
You can also reference or even use those to your liking.

> The GPL _does not require you to release your modified version_, or any part of it.
> 
> You are _free to make modifications and use them privately_, without ever releasing them.
> This applies to organizations (including companies), too;
> an organization can make a modified version and use it internally without ever releasing it outside the organization.
> 
> But _if you release the modified version to the public in some way_,
> the GPL requires you to _make the modified source code available_ to the program's users, _under the GPL_.
> 
> Thus, the GPL gives permission to release the modified program in certain ways,
> and not in other ways; but the decision of whether to release it is up to you.
